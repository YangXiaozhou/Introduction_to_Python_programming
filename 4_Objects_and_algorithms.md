# Objects and algorithms

This chapter introduces us to two fundamental pillars of knowledge in computer science: object-oriented programming (OOP) and algorithms. Breadth over depth is emphasized in this chapter. 

## Objects

### What are objects?

Objects are concepts from OOP paradigm. 

- OOP is a paradigm, in contrast to, e.g., procedural and functional programming, where custom data types are defined and used with custom methods defined for them. 
- Class: We usually refer to such a data type as a class with custom methods and variables (also known as class attributes). 
- Objects and instances: An object or instance is what we usually refer to a particular "variable" created from a class. For example:
    - From a `person` class, we can create a particular person, e.g., `David` or `Mary`.
    - From a `book` class, we can create a particular book, e.g., `book_A` or `book_B`.

Therefore, to understand the class-instance relationship, we can think of the relationship between an unfilled form and a filled one: An unfilled form represents a template, a class; The form can then be filled with different information by different people to create different instances. 

### Objects and instances in Python

Just like how we need to declare a function before using it, to work with objects and instances, we first need to declare the class. Declaring classes in Python is essentially teaching the computer what kind of concepts make sense for the class object. For example

- To make a `book` class, each book instance could have a title, an author, a publication date, etc.
- To make a `person` class, each person instance could have a name, an age, an eye color, etc.

During declaration, Python uses the dot syntax `self.` to assign or access its attributes such as title or author. 

- For example, to set a book instance's name as `'Python Programming'`, we can write: `self.name = 'Python Programming'`.
