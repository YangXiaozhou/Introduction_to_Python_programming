    "## Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "First up, is computing and programming the same thing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing is loosely anything we do that involves computers. Programming is the act of giving a set of instructions for computers to act on. Computing is about what we want to do with computers using the programming language that we learnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used programming vocabularies to distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Program and code\n",
    "    - Program: A set of lines of code that usually serve one overall function. \n",
    "    - A line of code: The smallest unit of programming that instructs computer to do something.\n",
    "2. Input and output\n",
    "    - Input: What a program takes in to work with.\n",
    "    - Output: What a program produces in return.\n",
    "3. Compiling and executing\n",
    "    - Compiling: Compilers look for syntax errors in our code, like proofreading an article.\n",
    "    - Executing: Actually running the program written. \n",
    "4. Console and graphical user interface (GUI):\n",
    "    - Console: Command-line interface that is solely based on text input and output, e.g., Terminal on Mac.\n",
    "    - GUI: Much more complex and commonly used interface of computer programs, e.g., Microsoft Word. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are programming languages?\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to write Japanese essays, we need to learn Japanese, Similarly, to write computer programs, we need to learn programming languages. However, languages differ in many ways, it's important to keep in mind the [language spectrum](https://www.realpythonproject.com/you-need-to-know-compiled-interpreted-static-dynamic-and-strong-weak-typing/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static and compiled: e.g., C, C++, Java. These languages do not allow variable type changes after declaration. The program is translated into machine-readable code at once. \n",
    "- Dynamic and interpreted: e.g., Python, JavaScript. These languages allow dynamically changing variable types. The program is translated into machine-readable code one line at a time."

    "- abstracts aways from core computer processor and memory and\n",

    "Multiple instructions are chained together through lines of code. When we wish to see the value of a variable or the result of a program, `print()` function is usually used. Also, it is recommended to work in small chunks of code at a time for Python programming. \n",

    "\n",
    "The difference between compiling and executing a program can be understood through the analogy of building a table with parts and instructions. Compiling means reading the instructions to make sure every parts are in place and the instructions make sense. Executing means actually building the table with the instructions. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Run as intended.\n",
    "2. Did not do what we intend it to do.\n",
    "3. Run into errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first case, we obtain correct results and we're happy. In the second case, the program executes successfully but produces incorrect results, e.g., instead of printing 1 to 10, it prints 1 to 9. In this case, we need to locate the code that causes the error and revise it. Finally, the program runs into errors and aborts right away. In another words, our program crashes. We need to locate the error-causing code and correct them."

    "2. Runtime error: These are errors encountered when we are building the table/running the code. For example, if one line of code tries to divide by zero, it would cause divide-by-zero error. \n",
