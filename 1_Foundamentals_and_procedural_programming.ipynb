    "### Computing vs programming\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computing is loosely anything we do that involves computers.\n",
    "- Programming is the act of giving a set of instructions for computers to act on.\n",
    "- Computing is about what we want to do with computers using the programming language that we learnt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "Program and code\n",
    "\n",
    "- A line of code: generally the smallest unit of programming that instructs computer to do something.\n",
    "- Program: a set of lines of code that usually serve one overall function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Input and output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: what a program takes in to work on.\n",
    "- Output: what a program produces in return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiling and executing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compiling: compilers look for syntax errors in our code, like proofreading an article.\n",
    "- Executing: actually running the program written. \n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- To write computer programs, we need to learn programming languages, like learning to write.\n",
    "- Languages differ in many ways, it's important to keep in mind the language spectrum.\n",
    "    - Static and compiled vs dynamic and interpreted. \n",
    "    - Execute one line at a time rather than script-based\n",
    "\n",
    "Console vs graphical user interface (GUI)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We interact with computer programs through interfaces, like Terminal and Words.\n",
    "- To focus our learning on computing, we start with text-based input and output.\n",

    "Created in 1990s, became popular in 2000s, one of the most popular today. Python is a high-level language: \n",
