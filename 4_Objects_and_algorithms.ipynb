    "## What are objects?\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are concepts from OOP paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "- OOP is a paradigm, in contrast to, e.g., procedural and functional programming, where custom data types are defined and used with custom methods defined for them. \n",
    "- Class: We usually refer to such a data type as a class with custom methods and variables (also known as class attributes). \n",
    "- Objects and instances: An object or instance is what we usually refer to a particular \"variable\" created from a class. For example:\n",
    "    - From a `person` class, we can create a particular person, e.g., `david` or `mary`.\n",
    "    - From a `book` class, we can create a particular book, e.g., `book_A` or `book_B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to understand the class-instance relationship, we can think of the relationship between an unfilled form and a filled one: An unfilled form represents a template, a class; The form can then be filled with different information by different people to create different instances. "
